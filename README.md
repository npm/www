field issues with the website.

## What This Repo Is

:white_check_mark: If there are major releases going out, we will write them up here.

:white_check_mark: If you are having issues with the website — it loads
too slow, or if you can't see a page you know exists, or complete a task
you know is possible — **please open an issue here**. If the topic is
sensitive, please [contact support](https://www.npmjs.com/support).

:white_check_mark: If you need something from the website — a new feature,
or improvements in an existing feature — **please open an issue here**. We will
take the feature under consideration: keep in mind, we often have to pass on
really good ideas due to time constraints.

policies of npm, please look at the 
[policies repository](https://github.com/npm/policies).
